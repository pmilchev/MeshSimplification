10 easy steps to setup a clear project using only the source files.

1. Create a new MS Visual Studio project:
	
2. Set upping the project(project / properties):
	> Configuration Properties / VC++ Directories/ Include Directories / Edit / and add new line 
	with the Dependencies/freeglut directory
	> Configuration Properties / "C/C++" / General / Additional Include Dependencies / and add new 
	line and select the "Dependencies" directory
	> Configuration Properties / Linker / General / Additional Library Directories / Edit / and 
	add "Dependencies/freeglut" directory
	> Configuration Properties / Linker / Input / Additional Dependencies / Edit / and 
	add freeglut.lib
	
3. Put a copy of "freeglut.dll" in the directory of the .exe file (probably /Debug)
	
Now you have a project that compiles. When ran, a flashing window shows and then it disappears. To 
fix that run the "exe" through the "cmd"

The program needs an input argument to work properly, the path to an "*.off" file describing the 
mesh.
1st Way: 
	> open cmd
	> navigate to the debug directory
	> input in the console _the_name_of_the_project_.exe _the_name_of_the_mesh_file_.off
2nd Way:
	> Configuration Properties / Debugging / Working Directory/ Browse and select the Debug Dir
	> Configuration Properties / Debugging / Command Arguments / Edit and add the name of the .off 
	file you want to start with
